# DeepPathMetabol
DeepPathMetabol (DPM) is a deep learning based method using H&E stain info and optimal transport theory to predict metabolite distributions and reconstruct high-resolution MSI data from small-sample inputs for cost-efficient, high-precision spatial metabolomics research.
Developer is Bo Yao from School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.
